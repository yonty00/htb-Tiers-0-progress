#Mongod
*Date Completed: 2025-10-02*

## Overview
- **Category:** Parrot Linux, Mongosh, Mongodb, Enumeration, Exploitation & Flag
- **Tier:** 0

## Tools Used
- Ping IP
- Nmap (sudo privilege) w/ switch -sV , --min-rate= , -p-
- Mongosh (Mongodb)

## What I Did / Approach
1. **Enumeration:**  
   - Ping Target's IP to detect connection to target
   - Used nmap for port scanning with sudo privileges, also switches such as, -sV, --min-rate=1000 and -p- 
     to detect open ports, service version, set minimum number of packets send and scan all TCP ports 
   - Two open ports, SSH and Mongodb on target machine 
   - Install Mongosh

2. **Exploitation:**  
   - Installed Mongosh to exploit Mongodb service
   - Run Mongosh command to connect to target machine
   - No privilege escalation needed for this Mongodb server as it did not requested credentials
   - Go through the dbs available, enumerate most important dbs and use the "<show collection;" command to find more details
   - Capture the flag inside of one of the collecitons (<db.flag.find()) 

3. **Privilege Escalation:**  
   - Priviledge escalation (sudo) was needed to install mongosh

4. ## What I Learned
   - Mongodb is a type of NoSQL database
   - Mongodb does not use tables or rows like other dbs, MongoDB uses collections and documents. The documents are what contain the key-values 
     which are the basic unit in a MongoDB databse 
   - Understanding the importance Mongodb and security, as databse contain a lot of important information
   - MongoDB uses different commands in order to explore the database, such as, ">use nameofcollection;" ">show collections;" , ">show dbs;"  , and ">db.nameofdocument.find();"

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Initially ran nmap for port scanning, discovered Mongodb service, connect to Mongodb to enumerate

- **Solution:** Explore the Mongodb, check collections and obtain the flag/hash
