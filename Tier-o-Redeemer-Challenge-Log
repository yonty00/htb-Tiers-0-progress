## Overview
- **Category:** Parrot Linux, Redis, Redis-CLI, Enumaration & Exploitation
- **Tier:** 0

## Tools Used
- Ping IP
- Nmap (sudo privilege) w/ flag -sV = Service/Version
- Reedis Database

## What I Did / Approach
1. **Enumeration:**  
   - Ping Target's IP to detect connection to target
   - Used nmap for port scanning with sudo privileges, detect open ports and find if the target is a server, and what type of server. 
     In this case, target is a Reedis database server.   
	   Sudo nmap -sV [target ip]

     - Detected port 6379/tcp running Reedis

2. **Exploitation:**  
   - Discovered that Redis protocol runs on port 6379/tcp
   - Attempted to login using Redis-cli -hostname Target IP
   - Access Reedis server and discovered db and keys using info command.
   - Access Access keys in order to retain the flag. Use "get command" to show keys info. 

3. **Privilege Escalation:**  
   - No priviledge escalation was needed for this lab.
   - No admin account or password require to login. Server is currently open, therefore access is granted by using the redis-cli command with -hostname flag.

4. ## What I Learned
   - Redis is a memory database that is typically used to cache data that is frequently requested for a quick retrieval. Data gets managed by the RAM. However, the retrieval
     time is very small. 
   - Database in Redis starts from "0", as "0" is considered "1 Database". 

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Initially ran nmap for port scanning, then after knowing the open for Redis, I proceeded to access the target/machine with Redis-cli tools 
            
- **Solution:** Using the Redis-cli tools I was able to find the db and keys where the flag was being contained.
