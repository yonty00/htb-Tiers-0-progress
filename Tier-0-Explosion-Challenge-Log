## Overview
- **Category:** Parrot Linux, RDP, xfreerdp, Enumeration, Exploitation & Flag
- **Tier:** 0

## Tools Used
- Ping IP
- Nmap (sudo privilege) w/ flag -sV = Service/Version
- Xfreerdp

## What I Did / Approach
1. **Enumeration:**  
   - Ping Target's IP to detect connection to target
   - Used nmap for port scanning with sudo privileges, detect open ports and find if the target is a server, and what type of server. 
     In this case, there are multiple ports open on target but one of these ports is running RDP on default port 3389/tcp.   
	   Sudo nmap -sV [target ip]

     - Detected port 3389/tcp running RDP

2. **Exploitation:**  
   - Discovered that RDP protocol runs on port 3389/tcp
   - Attempted to RDP the target using xfreerdp
   - Access target to discovered is a Windows server
   - Access flag as it is in the target's desktop 

3. **Privilege Escalation:**  
   - No priviledge escalation was needed for this lab as RDP is misconfigured on this machine 
   - No admin account or password was required to login. RDP is currently open on this machine, therefore access is granted by using xfreerdp tool.

4. ## What I Learned
   - RDP runs on port 3389/TCP and 3389/UDP
   - RDP could be misconfigured and access can be granted with no permission needed, or credentials
   - xfreerdp is a tool that helps access Remote Desktop Protocol on other machines
   - There are multiple programs that can run RDP, such as, Telnet (unsecure), SSH, even Teamviewer and Zendesk, also Microsoft Remote Desktop connection runs
	 Natively in Windows machine

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Initially ran nmap for port scanning, then discovered multiple open ports, for this lab 3389/TCP RDP

- **Solution:** Using the xfreerdp I was able to RDP into the target's machine and retrieved the flag
