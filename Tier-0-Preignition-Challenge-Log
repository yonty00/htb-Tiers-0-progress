## Overview
- **Category:** Parrot Linux, Golang, Gobuster, Wordlists, Enumeration, Exploitation & Flag
- **Tier:** 0

## Tools Used
- Ping IP
- Nmap (sudo privilege) w/ flag -sV = Service/Version
- Golang / Gobuster
- Wordlists

## What I Did / Approach
1. **Enumeration:**  
   - Ping Target's IP to detect connection to target
   - Used nmap for port scanning with sudo privileges, -sV flag and detect open ports. 
     In this case, the target is running a HTTP service on port 80/tcp
   - Install Golang and Gobuster

2. **Exploitation:**  
   - Use web browser (Firefox) to inspect the website and analyze
   - Website is running nginx
   - Run Gobuster with proper flags and specific wordlists to discover any hidden web directories
     Flags such as "dir" to specify tool, -w specifies the wordlists, and -u for Target's IP address
   - Access hidden php directory and using default login to enter
   - Retain flag/hash

3. **Privilege Escalation:**  
   - Priviledge escalation (sudo) was needed to install golang and gobuster
   - Download Seclist from github repository to use as a wordlist 
   - Default credentials were needed to access the hidden php web directory

4. ## What I Learned
   - Websites have hidden directories 
   - Gobuster can help find those hidden directories to exploit 
   - Previous Wordpress has many vulnerabilities
   - Understanding the importance of web security, such as, changing default credentials, and the differences between HTTP & HTTPS

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Initially ran nmap for port scanning, then discovered HTTP open port

- **Solution:** Using gobuster and wordlist I was able to discover the hidden php directory and exploit it
